solids4foam allows solid mechanics and fluid-solid interaction simulations to be performed natively within OpenFOAM.

# Quick start

## Supported versions of OpenFOAM

By the time of writing this tutorial, to get the most out of solids4Foam, you need first to get
foam-extend 4.0 or 4.1. While other OpenFOAM forks are also partially compatible with
solids4Foam, some features are currently supported only by foam-extend.
